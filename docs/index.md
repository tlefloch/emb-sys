# Welcome to the Embedded Systems course

## Definition

An embedded system is a specialized computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.  
It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints.

- the configuration of the network interface of an embedded system
- how to test and modify the embedded OS directly on your host machine (QEMU, mounting, etc)
- containerization (Docker)
