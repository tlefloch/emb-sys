# A. Git Repository

## 1. Create the Repository

Create a **private** repository on [GitLab](https://gitlab.ensta-bretagne.fr/) named: **`embsys-ubuntulab`**

Add the teacher (**Tristan LE FLOCH**) as a **Reporter** member of the project.

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

On your computer, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store your work.  

Create a working directory for this lab:

```bash
mkdir ubuntulab
cd ubuntulab
```

Then clone your repository using:

```bash
git clone <link_to_your_gitlab_repo>
```

You can then open your local git repo in your preferred IDE or file editor

---

## 3. Submit your work

Regularly upload your progress to GitLab using standard Git commands:

- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`

!!! Note
    Make sure your online repository always contains the latest version of your work
